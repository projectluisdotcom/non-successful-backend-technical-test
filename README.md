# README

This is a non-succesful test for a Barcelona based company.

## About the test

- You can find the feedback translated directly from Spanish at `./feedback.md`
- I removed all data realted to the company and all my personal data.
- I removed a bunch of pre-coocked text they added to make this reject less "harmful", this included quotes from famous programmers and another bunch of poetry non-sense.
- Take in account I had litle with PHP (the languague I choosed for the algorithm part) and Java back in the day (they already knew that), so I guess the main reason because they rejected me was because they would need someone with more experience, however most of my test is not wrong at all.
- I respect their decision but if someday I found someone without experience and they manage to answer my test with success I would like to know more about the candidate long-term potential.
- I had a limited time to deliver the test. (Around 3 hours)
- I replaced the comapny real name with {Company Name}
