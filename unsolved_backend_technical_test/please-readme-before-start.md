Welcome to {COMPANY NAME} Technical Test for Backend Developers

We have divided the test into 3 areas:

Algorithms: Where you will find 3 exercises to get yourself into action (don't worry, there are no stupid graph or binary trees questions!). Please follow the instructions inside that folder.

Miscellaneous: Where you will get a number of questions about real life problems. It is ok if you don't know most of the answers (or any at all!) but this lets us know your systems skills a little more.

OOProgramming: Where you will find an exercise where you need to create a command line application which can do energy readings fraud detection. This is the most important (and the longest) part of the exam and although you can complete it in 2-3h or so, we expect you to show your skillset here! Please follow the instructions inside the folder!
In this exercise, we are looking for things like:

- an explanation on how to run the tests and the code, how to install the requirements, etc.
- hexagonal architecture to handle different inputs (CSV and XML in this case, but it could be a database or even a txt file in a remote FTP! True story...)

Bonus points if you use:

- idiomatic features of the language
- unit tests for your domain classes

Finally, we would appreciate your feedback on this test.
We know it is tedious to do them but it also takes a lot of time to prepare them and make them fair for everybody.

Good luck and we are waiting for your answers!
