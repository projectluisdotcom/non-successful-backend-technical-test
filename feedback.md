# Feedback

This test was divided in 3 sections.

- Questions
- Solo Algorithms in PHP
- A full Java project

## Solo Algorithms

### Sorting

Output is correct.
In PHP methods go as camelCase, so “Sort” seems off.
You could simplify the function using the <=> operator.
(https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php).

### Strings

Output is correct.
You could use the case insensitive function of str_replace (str_ireplace) to avoid repeating characters in the config.

### Matrix

Output is correct.
You don't need to check if the matrix is empty or is not uniform (in fact, some algorithms works in both cases). On the other hand, you could have used functions like array_map.

# Questions

The questions are ok in general, on the other hand the query is incorrect.

# OOprograming

We know you had little time to complete this challenge and this could affect your code, so don't take this feedback as something personal.

In general we liked the solution, is well structured and follows design patterns. Our recomendation is that you need to add more test since they cover just the domain part, this will make parts of your solution weak like file reading.

Lastly, we liked you used git and added docker since this was not mandatory and we enjoy that kind of feature when we see this kind of tests.
